## Javascript Jupyter Notebook
```
npm install -g ijavascript
ijsinstall
```
To make vscode run the new kernel, first run jupyter from terminal with 
```
jupyter notebook
```
Then select a kernel from there to make Jupyter recognise it
Paste the jupyter url into "connect to remote kernel"
from then on, VSCode should remember the new `iJavascript` kernel
